# Dad-sGame

I used the pygame module to make the game where you move around numbered boxes to get them in order

My dad gave me the idea for it so I decided to call it Dad's Game

Once you run the main file, a randomized map will automatically be generated. 
You must click on an ajacent box to the empty square to move it over.
Your objective orientation is as follows...

1 2 3 
4 5 6
7 8 []

Enjoy!!
